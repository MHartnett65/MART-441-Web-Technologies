I used ai as I usually do to help me get started and focus on the objective at hand. I am really appreciative on how you have shown us this great tool it helps me focus on the important stuff and fun stuff we are learning then spending time in the grindy nature of code. It has elevated my learning experience and I feel like it is helping me on my academic journey! Sorry this is late I was going to attempt to do more with this assignment but I thought I had another week then I did I hope you enjoy it and I will be working on my final assignment this week.
