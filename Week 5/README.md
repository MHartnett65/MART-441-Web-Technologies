    This is the first time I got to utilize it in an assignment. I could not figure it out before so finally figuring it out opened my eyes to the endless opportunities. It gave me a really detailed roadmap and I was able to accomplish what I wanted to do. It was a little frustrating at first due to the fact I just could not for the life of me look up what I needed to to get me to where I needed to be. I was either to broad or have one of the tiny details to be asked to be wrong. The one thing I really enjoyed about this program is it kept your results to add onto it. It felt like a calculator that knew everything. I really enjoyed this experience and then being able to focus on the nitty gritty details. I could not for the life of me figure out a score system that. I figured out how to make it reset but if I took out where I was going to have a score system it would make it not restart after a match. I also had to figure out how to make the images not be the size they actually were. It was quite fun and a puzzle. I usually struggle with getting started but seeing how this will give me the step in the right direction is amazing.
