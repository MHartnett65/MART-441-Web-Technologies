# MART-441
 This week was really hard I still was not able to figure out how to give an ending to it. I felt like I kept spinning my wheels without a stopping point. I feel more comfortable with the functions and the example as a stepping off point was extremely helpful. I also took some lessons from my classmates and felt like I will be able to learn the things from our group and am starting to believe in myself this semster. Lets see what next week has in store!
