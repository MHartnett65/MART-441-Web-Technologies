I used AI to help me format and see what I was doing wrong. I had really tough time with the modeling and ai helped me find different ways to fix issues that I had. It showed me how to plug in the cdn to make three.js work. I have really enjoyed it as a tool in my tool bag because it felt like a way to ask a question I have had and get back an instant answer to solve my problem. I believe it has helped me with formating as well as cleaning up my code with notes and where I can adjust the qualities I want. Where I want them. I was not able to get the modeling done and included where I had the loader from the example page but I kept getting the same error. I tried to follow along with the video but just got frustrated with the whole thing and wanted to make sure I had homework to turn in. Thank you for everything!
