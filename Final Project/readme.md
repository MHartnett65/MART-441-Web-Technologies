I wanted to take a moment and talk about my final project. I took inspiration from the game loneliness and wanted to do a simple game with a powerful concept. Where you are the lone square avoiding the colonialism that has been left with us today. Where the square will shrink and disapear after getting hit to much. Because without our cultural footprint they would of won by erasing our culture and who we are. It is meant to be an educational game to show what it was like as well as make others think. This is just a prototype and I hope to work on it more in the future and to get it published. Thank you for this opportunity and hope you enjoy my work. It made me sad making it but I wanted to provide a project that makes the user think and to bring awareness to an on going issue
